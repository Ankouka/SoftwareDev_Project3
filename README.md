This is the third software project I worked on with my team in our Software Devlopment class. Here is the decription of this software project:

# Description
We created a dating website where a user can make a account and dating profile. They then can start looking for their partner and chat with them so they can get to know them. 
# User Stories

US#1
As an unregistered user, I aim to sign up to create my account and share information about myself, with the goal of finding a perfect match. Once I complete all the necessary fields and information required for my profile, my account will be saved. This will enable me to log in using the 'Sign In' button whenever I want to access my account.

US#2
As a user logging into my account, Once authenticated, I land on the homepage featuring profiles presented for potential matches with a checkmark and an X. There should be navigational buttons for editing profile, and viewing chats.

US#3
As a user, I want to easily modify and update my profile information. Upon accessing the homepage, I click the 'Edit Profile' button, enabling me to adjust details like bio, photos, preferences, or any relevant information. After making changes, I confirm the updates and they are saved.

US#4
As a user seeking potential matches viewing available profiles, I encounter profiles aligning with my gender preference. There are buttons with a checkmark and an X. If I like someone, I click the checkmark, and if I don't, I click the X. This helps me pick the people I want to match with or not match with.

US#5
As a user who has found matches on the homepage, I check the 'Matches' section to see people who also liked me. Once there, I choose someone from the list by clicking on their profile. This action opens a chat window, allowing me to start a conversation with that person. This way, I can easily connect with someone I matched with and start getting to know them better through chatting.

US#6
As a tester responsible for the user authentication module of our web application, I want to ensure its robustness, security, and seamless functionality to provide a positive user experience. This involves both white-box and black-box testing methodologies.

US#7 (optional)
As a user, I want to engage in conversations with 100% real (totally real) celebrity profiles, which are certainly NOT AI chatbots like ChatGPT. When I visit the platform's chat section, I select a profile and a TOTALLY REAL celebrity responds to my messages instantly (because Iâ€™m that important).

# Development Process
This section should be used to describe how the scrum methodology was used in this project. As a suggestion, include the following table to summarize how the sprints occurred during the development of this project.

Sprint#	Goals	Start	End	Done	Observations
1	US#1, US#2	11/09/23	11/16/23	US#1 and US#2	Time was our biggest concern during this sprint
2	US#3, US#4	11/16/23	11/30/23	US#3 and US#4	Time was less of a concern but now its Error that became the new concern
3	US#5, US#6	11/30/23	12/7/23	US#5 and US#6	Error and testing was a concern

White Test:
A unittest test case that verifies the profile creation functionality in the application. This test simulates the process of creating a user profile in the application, ensuring that the profile is successfully created and stored in the database. The test operates in a controlled environment using an in-memory SQLite database, which allows for testing without affecting the actual database.

Black Test:
this test case checks whether the profile update endpoint in a Flask application works as expected when a user attempts to update their profile, particularly focusing on whether it returns a successful response when provided with valid input.
